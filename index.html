My name is Frank Tonye,i'm from Rivers State and i stay i Port Harcourt. <br>
I come from a fast growing city,a city full of hustlers of all age groups <br>
that one would feel the impact of being left behind. <br>
The fear of not having to step up to this growth by the society is what inspires me <br>
to enroll in this program. 
I also draw some inspiration from myself for wanting to make a positive impact on <br>
 the society and most especially my immediate sorrounding,my friends and family  <br>
 by endeavoring to use the knowledge i would be blessed with from this program to <br>
 help in anyway i can, to also put them at a better place,both financially and otherwise. <br>
The goal is to try as much as i can to learn to a point where i'm good enough to be globally <br>
recognized as a programmer. <br>
i know this is possible with my hard work,zeal and the love i've always had for programming <br>
especially the ones capacity bay has given us the rare and golden opportunity to learn. <br>
In 5years i would be internationally reckoned with as a top programmer. <hr size="2" color="blue">
